# MaliciousURLS

URL can also be used to lure people to submit their personal information on a fake website. This makes these people share their personal and sensitive information with unknown people. They use the information for an ulterior motive. The harm caused by these malicious URLs can be very large.

In this project, I tried to build a machine learning model that can be able to detect these malicious URLs. I trained the model using a dataset with URLs labeled both bad and good. I used Scikit-learn Python library along with pandas, Numpy and many more.
